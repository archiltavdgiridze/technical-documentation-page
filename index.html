              JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
              language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host
              environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
              connected to the objects of its environment to provide
              programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
              Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
              operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
              be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
              additional objects; for example:
            </p>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.

            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <li>
              A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
              (WWW).
            </li>
            <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>

            <p>
              JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
              different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java
              but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
              JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
              and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
              renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
              declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a
              small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and
              string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model
              instead of the more common class-based object model. The
              prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what
              is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
              supports functions without any special declarative requirements.
              Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
              methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do
              not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do
              not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private,
              or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
              Variables, parameters, and function return types are not
              explicitly typed.

            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>
              To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and
              write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
            </p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code>
                <p>function greetMe(yourName) {</p>
                <p>alert("Hello " + yourName);</p>
                <p>}</p>
                <p>greetMe("World");</p>
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in
              your browser!

          <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>
              You use variables as symbolic names for values in your
              application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform
              to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_),
              or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits
              (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
              characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a"
              through "z" (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
              identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
              characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
              Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
            <header>Declaring Variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
            <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code> var x = 42; </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This syntax can be used to declare both local and global
              variables.
            </p>
            <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code> x = 42; </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
              JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
            </p>
            <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code> let y = 13; </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.
              See Variable scope below.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
            <header>Variable Scope</header>
            <p>
              When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called
              a global variable, because it is available to any other code in
              the current document. When you declare a variable within a
              function, it is called a local variable, because it is available
              only within that function.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
              scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
              function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
              example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is
              the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not
              the block, which in this case is an if statement.
            </p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5 </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced
              in ECMAScript 2015.
            </p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code>
                if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
                - not defined
              </code>
            </div>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="Global_Variables">
            <header>Global Variables</header>
            <p>
              Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In
              web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access
              global variables using the window.variable syntax.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one
              window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the
              window or frame name. For example, if a variable called
              phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this
              variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <p>
              You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
              The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
              identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
              and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
            </p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code> const PI = 3.14; </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              A constant cannot change value through assignment or be
              re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized
              to a value.
            </p>
            <p>
              The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
              scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier
              is assumed to represent a variable.
            </p>
            <p>
              You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
              variable in the same scope. For example:
            </p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code>
                // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; //
                THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
                //statements }
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
              statement is executed without problems.
            </p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code>
                const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"};
                <br />
                MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
              </code>

                  <li>
                    Null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                    JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                    NULL, or any other variant.

                  <li>

                    Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example:

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    String. A sequence of characters that represent a text

              Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they
              enable you to perform useful functions with your applications.
              Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the
              language. You can think of objects as named containers for values,
              and functions as procedures that your application can perform.

          <section class="main-section" id="If_Else_Statement">
            <header>If Else Statement</header>
            <p>
              Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition
              is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if
              the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code>
                if (condition) { statement_1;
                <br />
                } else { statement_2; }
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false.
              See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and
              false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed;
              otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2
              can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may also compound the statements using else if to have
              multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
            </p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code>
                if (condition_1) { <br />
                statement_1;<br />
                } else if (condition_2) { <br />statement_2; <br />} else if
                (condition_n) { <br />statement_n;<br />
                } else { statement_last; <br />}
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical
              condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute
              multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... })
              . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements,
              especially when nesting if statements:
            </p>

                if (condition) { <br />statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;

            <p>
              It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
              expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality
              when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following
              code:
            </p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code> if (x = y) { /* statements here */ } </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a
              common practice is to put additional parentheses around the
              assignment. For example:
            </p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code> if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ } </code>
            </div>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="While_Statement">
            <header>While Statement</header>
            <p>
              A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
              condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code> while (condition) statement </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops
              executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
            </p>
            <p>
              The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is
              executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and
              the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false,
              execution stops and control is passed to the statement following
              while.
            </p>
            <p>
              To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
              group those statements.
            </p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>
              The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
            </p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code>
                var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to
              x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
              <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
              <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer
              true, so the loop terminates.

            <header>Function Declarations</header>
            <p>
              A function definition (also called a function declaration, or
              function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The name of the function.</li>
              <li>
                A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                separated by commas.
              </li>
              <li>
                The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
                curly brackets, { }.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              For example, the following code defines a simple function named
              square:
            </p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code> function square(number) { return number * number; } </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              The function square takes one argument, called number. The
              function consists of one statement that says to return the
              argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself.
              The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.
            </p>
            <div id="code-div">
              <code> return number * number; </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
              value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
              changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
              globally or in the calling function.
            </p>
